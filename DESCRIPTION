Title: Tools for accessing the Google Maps API
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Derek Darves
Maintainer: Derek Darves <darves@gmail.com>
Description: The main functions in this package are \code{\link{drive_time}}
	(used for calculating distances between physical addresses) and
	\code{\link{geocode_url}} (used for estimating lat/long coordinates
	of a physical address). At the time this package was authored, there were no
	readily available packages which generated the cryptogric signatures necessary for
	making API calls with a (paid) Google for Work account within the geocoding process itself
	(hence the motivation for it's authorship). These paid accounts have much large quota limits than
	the "standard_api" and, thus, placement may be useful for indivuals who
	would prefer to submit large batch jobs to the Google Maps API from within R.
	While the main benefit of this package is it's ability to generate properly signed
	URLs with the \code{\link{digest::hmac}} sha1 algorithm, it also provides methods
	for accessing the standard API using a (free) Google API key
	(see \href{https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-an-api-key}{this page} to obtain a key).
